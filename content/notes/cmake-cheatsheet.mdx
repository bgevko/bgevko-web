## Create a new build
```bash
# Set the minimum required version of CMake for this project.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)

# Define the name of the project. This name is used for organizational purposes
# and does not determine the names of any output binaries.
project(MyProject)

# Add an executable target to the project. This command specifies that an 
# executable named MyApp should be built from the source file main.cpp.
# You can add more source files separated by spaces if needed.
add_executable(MyApp main.cpp)

# (Optional) If you have other source files or libraries to include, 
# you can use commands like `target_link_libraries` or `target_include_directories`.
```
```Cpp
// main.cpp:
#include <iostream> 
int main(){   std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;   return 0; }
```
```Bash
# Create a build folder
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake -S .. -B . # S and D flags represent source dir and build dir
```
```Bash
# Build the project
make # (from the build directory)
```
## Adding a library
Create a new directory, `my_library` (or any name). I'll create an example library called `adder`. I'll also create two files in this directory: `adder.h` and `adder.cpp`.
``` Cpp
// adder.h:
namespace mymath{ 	int add(int a, int b); 	float add(float a, float b); }
```
```cpp
// adder.cpp:
#include "adder.h" int mymath::add(int a, int b){ 	return a + b; } float mymath::add(float a, float b){ 	return a + b; }
```
```bash
# CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2) 
project(MyProject) 
add_executable(MyApp main.cpp)

# Add the library directory to the include path. This is where the 
# header file is located.
include_directories(my_library)

# Add the library. First argument is what you want to name the target,
# and the second argument is the path to the library source files.
add_library(Adder my_library/adder.cpp) 

# Link the library to the executable. and INTERFACE. 
target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE Adder)
```
<Callout>
Note that `PRIVATE` represents the visibility of the library. `PRIVATE` means that the library is only used by the target. Other options are `PUBLIC` and `INTERFACE`. `PUBLIC` means that the library is used by the target and any targets that link to this target. `INTERFACE` means that the library is used by any targets that link to this target, but not the target itself. 

In our case, the target is `MyApp`, but bigger projects may have multiple targets, so the visibility options are a powerful way to control dependencies.
</Callout>
```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream> 
#include "adder.h" 
int main()
{     
	int a = 1;     
	int b = 2;     
	std::cout << "a + b = " << mymath::add(a, b) << std::endl;     
	return 0; 
}
```

With this setup, we can go to the **build** directory and build the project:
```bash
cd build
make
```

## Linking a compiled library

The above approach works for linking a library when you have access to the source code and you want to compile the library yourself.
However, sometimes you may not have access to the library source code. Sometimes, you only have access to the compiled library file. 
Note that compiled libraries still need a header file to use them.
Compiled libraries usually have these file extensions:

**STATIC**: `.a`, `.lib`

**SHARED**: `.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`

<Callout>
Note that `.lib` and `.dll` are used on Windows, `.a` and `.so` are used on Linux, and `.a` and `.dylib` are used on macOS.
</Callout>

Static means that a library will be compiled into your executable. This means that the library code is "embedded" into your final application. 
If multiple executable files use it, then the library code will be duplicated in each of them. 

A shared library is not embedded into your application. Instead, it is loaded at runtime. This means that if multiple executable files use it, 
then the library code will be loaded only once in memory. However, this also means that you need to distribute the library 
file with your application and make sure that the library is available on the user's machine. Static libraries are usually easier to use, 
but shared libraries are more efficient. Here's how to link a pre-compiled library:

In this example, I'll use two files in the `my_library` directory:
```bash
libAdder.a # static library
adder.h    # library header file
```
```bash
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2) 
project(MyProject) 
add_executable(MyApp main.cpp) 
include_directories(my_library) 
target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/my_library/libAdder.a)
```

I'm including the header file in the `my_library` directory, then I'm calling `target_link_libraries` 
the same way as before, but this time linking to the `a` file. Although I'm linking a static library,
the approach is the same for the other types as well.

Note that `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` is part of the Cmake API and it represents the root directory where `CMakeLists.txt` is located.
