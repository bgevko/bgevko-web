I learned how to do this for my old site, which was running on a 
Digital Ocean and configured with `NGINX`. Below, I recorded the process, 
mostly for my own reference.

1. Install Certbot
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

2. Create the cert. `school.bgevko.com` is the example domain.
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d school.bgevko.com
```

3. Set up automatic renewal
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

4. Restart NGINX
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

And that's it! Certbot will automatically renew the certificate when it's close to expiring.
Cerbot creates a cron job under the hood. You can check it with:
```bash
cat /etc/cron.d/certbot
```
