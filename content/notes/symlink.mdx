What is a symlink? A symlink is a shortcut to a file or directory. 
It's like a shortcut on Windows or a symbolic link on Mac. 
It's a way to make a command line tool work globally from any directory. I needed
to learn how to use a symlink when I created a command line tool with Python for the first time.
I recorded the process below, mostly for my own reference.

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin # Path to binary dir, may vary based on OS
sudo ln -s /~Projects/my-project/my-tool.py my-tool # Create the symlink
cd /~Projects/my-project # Tool source directory
chmod +x my-tool.py # Make the file executable

# Execute from any directory
my-tool
```
