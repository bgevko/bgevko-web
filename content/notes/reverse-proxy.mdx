In this example, I'll set up an instance of Node for general use on a virtual server and open it up to the public internet using NGINX as a reverse proxy.

### Configuration File
---
First, I'll create a new file called `dev` in the `sites-available` directory.
```bash
sudo nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/dev
```

Then, I'll add the following:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name dev.bgevko.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
A few notes here:
- `dev.bgevko.com` is the subdomain I own. This domain is pointed to the IP address of the virtual server.
- `localhost:3000` is the address of the Node instance I want to open up to the public internet.

### Enabling the Configuration
---
Next, I'll enable the configuration by creating a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory.
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dev /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
We can check that the link was created successfully by running:
```bash
ls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
You should be able to see `dev` in the output.

We can restart NGINX to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

If you get an error, you can check the logs by running:
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
#### Optional
You can secure your domain using Certbot. [How?](https://www.bgevko.com/blog/https-using-certbot)

### Conclusion
---
You're all set! If you run your Node instance on port 3000, you'll be able to access it at the domain you specified.
