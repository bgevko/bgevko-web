## How I used my partner's API
- Set the framework for dynamic images. The test [page](https://bgevko.com/blog/article) is still up demonstrating the functinoality.


## Inclusivity Heuristics
1. Benefits of new features are clear, but optional. 
2. Costs of new features are low. Explanation is provided where necessary.
3. People are free to gather as much or little information as they want. In my case, the user
can choose not to click the info icons.
4. The design is familiar such that it follows standard web conventions.
5. Undo redo is possible through the browser or through site navigation.
6. The user has an explicit part to any part of the site from any given page.
7. The UI provides a natural flow for user naviation. Users can go sections in multiple ways.
8. The user can is encouraged to explore the site through dynamic elements. Everything that can be interacted with shows visible feedback.

## Quality Attribute
- Adaptability: Every part of the site is mobile friendly and responsive to all screen sizes.

## Code Scroll
- I wrote a lot of code for this project. I can't scroll through it all, but I can show a few examples and provide a link to the repo.
