## Finding things
- `fd -t f "Linux Cheatsheet"`: Finds the file starting from the current dir
- `fd -t d "Dir name"`: Finds a directory starting from the current dir
## Copy STDOUT to clipboard (macOS)
- `<command> | pbcopy`: Copies output of command to clipboard
## Check Command History
- `history | grep <command>`: Shows the entire history of a given command
## Compress and Extract using Tar
- `tar -xvf filename.tar`: Extracts .tar into current dir
- `tar czvf file.tar.gz <directory>`: Compresses a file or directory

## Redirection and piping
- `command > file`: Redirects the output of a command to a file
- `command >> file`: Appends the output of a command to a file
- `command < file`: Redirects the input of a command from a file
- `command1 | command2`: Pipes the output of command1 to the input of command2

You can mix and match:
```bash
grep "search_term" input.txt | sort | uniq > output.txt
```
- `grep`: Searches for a pattern in `input.txt`
- `| sort`: Takes the output of `grep` and sorts it
- `| uniq`: Takes the output of `sort` and removes duplicates
- `> output.txt`: Takes the output of `uniq` and writes it to `output.txt`

Here's another example:
```bash
cat < input.txt | grep "search_term" | sort > output.txt
```
- `cat < input.txt`: Takes the contents of `input.txt` and passes it to `cat`
- `| grep "search_term"`: Takes the output of `cat` and searches for a pattern
- `| sort`: Takes the output of `grep` and sorts it
- `> output.txt`: Takes the output of `sort` and writes it to `output.txt`

## Processes
```bash
# Finding Processes
ps aux # List all processes
ps aux | grep <name> # List all processes with <name>
pgrep -f <name> # List all processes with <name>
ps aux | grep Z # List all zombie processes
```

```bash
# Killing Processes
kill <pid> # Kill process with <pid>
kill -9 <pid> # Kill process with <pid> (force)
killall <name> # Kill all processes with <name>
kill %<number> # Kill background process <number>
# Other commands work with %<number> as well
```
```bash
# Background Processes
command & # Run command in background
jobs # List all background processes
fg <job> # Bring background process <job> to foreground
fg %<number> # Bring background process <number> to foreground
bg <job> # Resume background process <job>
bg %<number> # Resume background process <number>
```
