description: Sometimes, simple programs don't require the full power of CMake, but it can also get tedious to build your program every time with terminal commands. I have just the solution for such cases.

Suppose you have a program that you're building and you constantly find yourself in the following pattern:
- Make changes to the code
- Close the current running instance
- Build the program
- Execute the program

This can become very tedious, especially if you're like me and like to check your work frequently. You can create a bash script to automate this process for you.

- Create a new file and call it something like `rebuild.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Kill the current process (assuming it's named 'sample')
pkill -f ./sample

# Compile the code, I have a makefile, but you can write your own build command here
make

# Run the program
./sample
```
- Give the file permission to execute:
```bash
chmod +x rebuild.sh
```

Now, you can run `./rebuild` and you just saved yourself a couple commands. You can add anything into the build script.
