I've been a programmer for over 1 year. I've worked on everything from 
Hello World software to a to-do app. I've worked on projects that have 
one user and projects that have zero users. I've worked on projects that 
have never been used by the public and projects that have never been used by 
me. But let's not focus on my credentials; they're solid, trust me, bro. 
Some guy on the internet said the following at some time:
> If there's an API, we'll program the software instead of using it.

> ~ Me, and probably someone else

I don't know what an API is, but if I'm ever using software that has an API, 
I'll most definitely start programming it instead of using the software. 
Especially if I'm supposed to be doing something else with the software. I 
won't do the thing that I'm supposed to be doing; I'll fiddle with the API 
instead to streamline my workflow.

Just the other day, I decided to take a break from my Hello World app and 
produce music with Reaper, a digital audio workstation. What did I make?
A script that makes music production easier. I didn't actually use the
script to make music; I just spent three days building the script and 
then I went back to programming my Hello World app. My life has no creative
fullfillment, but at least I know that when I go back to making music again,
that script is there waiting for me, begging for me to refactor it.

Why do programmers do this? We can't help it. We don't use software, we program it. 
Unless we're supposed to use the software to program the software. No, wait, 
we'll program the software to program the software too. Oh, how is my 
Hello World app doing? Not good. I haven't worked on it because I'm too 
busy configuring my Neovim setup.
