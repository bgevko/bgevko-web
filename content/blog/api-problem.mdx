I've been a programmer for over 1 year. I've worked on everything from
hello world software to a todo app. I've worked on projects that have
one user and projects that have zero users. I've worked
on projects that have never been used by the public and projects that have
been used by a by me. Let me tell you something: **I know what I'm talking about**.

> If there's an API, we'll program the software instead of using it.

That's my quote. You heard it here first.

I'm not sure what an API is, but I know that if I ever see one, I'll program it.
Especially if I'm supposed to be doing something else with the software. I won't do
the thing that I'm supposed to be doing, I'll be programming the API instead.

I know I'm not the only one who does this. Anyone else who tells you otherwise hasn't
been programming for long enough.

Why do we do this? Because we're programmers. We don't use software, we program it. Unless
we're supposed to use the software to program the software. No, wait, we'll program the software
to program the software too. That's what we do. That's what we always do. How does anything
even get done? I don't know, I'm too busy configuring my Neovim setup to highlight 
my TODOs in a different color.
