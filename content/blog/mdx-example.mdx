<Callout>
	I'm writing this inside of a `Callout` component. You're seeing the nice rendered box, but
	what it actually looks like in my markdown file is this:
	```jsx
	<Callout>
		My Text
	</Callout>
	```
</Callout>

This entire article is written in MDX.
What is MDX? It's a combination of Markdown and JSX. 
It's a way to use React components inside of Markdown.

To give another example, here's a random `code` block:

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

Do you see how there's a copy botton in the top right corner
of the code block? That's because I'm using a custom MDX component.

How does it work? 

Well, in my case, I'm using Next with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote),
which parses my MDX files and provides a rendered HTML version of them to
my Next app. I get to define custom components that will be rendered.

For example, any instance of a `pre` tag will be rendered with my custom component
that adds the copy button. Of course, there's a lot more to it than that, but that's
the gist of it.

So here are some examples of all the elements that are available to me directly from MDX:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
> Blockquote

*Italic* **Bold** `Inline Code`
```js
// Code Block
```

Image:
<Image src="/test-images/img1.png" alt="Image" width="500" height="500" />

There's a few more, but you get the idea.

There are a lot of possibilities. It makes creating web content very easy.
Gone are the days where you have to edit your HTML files directly. 

The design is modular. I can change any component I want, or add new ones. For example,
I'll add a `Video` component later. It will allow me to embed a YouTube video in my article.
directly into my article from my markdown file, and I won't have to worry
about formatting and styling; all of that is taken care of when I define the component.

Of course, there are some downsides. MDX can be a bit of a footgun. Your error handling
has to be very good, or you can end up with a broken page if you make a mistake when
calling a custom component. 

Also, the setup can be a bit tricky. I spent a lot of time prowling through GitHub repos
for examples to get my setup working. One repo that I found particularly helpful was 
[taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonomy/tree/main) by [Shadcn](https://shadcn.com/).

Taxonomy is an example of a modern Next.js 13 app that uses server components. 
The bundled and deployed repo is presented as well as the demo [website](https://tx.shadcn.com/).

Anyways, that's all I have to say about MDX for now. I'm sure I'll have 
more things to share about it as I dive deeper into it and flesh out my website. 

Thanks for reading!
