2023 was an incredibly fruitful year regarding my development as a.. developer. Here are some of the things I worked on:
- Created a static website for my biology final.
- Created a random data generator tool with `React` with a responsive web UI
- Created some scripts for my music hobbies for both Reaper and Renoise digital audio workstations, 
exposing me `Lua`. 
- Created a personal portfolio site with `React`. Then, I built it again in `NextJS` from scratch. 
- Ditched VS Code in favor of a custom Neovim setup. Those Lua skills came in handy when I spent a week building out my editor configurations. 
- Built a C++ command line program that converted ripped SNES music (SPC format) to playable/remixable WAV format for music production. 
- Created a command line tool that fetches my previously defined coding templates from a GitHub repo. This makes creating prototypes and starting new projects a breeze!
- Built a content management system with `Markdown` and `React`. I built it again for my new site using `MDX`. I learned so much about building and rendering content through markdown!
- Learned how to deploy my projects on a virtual private server. 
- Created a basic 3D rendering application with `C++` and `OpenGL`.
- Completed Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Development, Computer Architecture & Assembly, Introduction to Computer Graphics Programming, and Operating Systems 1. These courses tied many previously loosely understood concepts together for me. 
- Registered for the Codepath iOS course, which will guide me through building an iOS app in February 2024. 

Despite the majority of 2023 feeling like I wasn't making any technical progress (I spent over half the year focusing on non-CS general education requirements for my degree), I'm delighted with my overall output.

I'm certain that I'll see even more growth in 2024. Here is a list of goals that I hope to accomplish this year:
- Finish [this](https://berrin-com.vercel.app/) website.
- Create a landing page/booking system for a nail technician.
- Create a 3D website using `Three.js`.
- Create a space on my website to host my GLSL shader creations.
- Create a metronome app for iOS. 
- Find an internship.

Most of my curriculum is filled with CS-related work this year, so I hope to blow this list out of the water. I'll check on this in a year and see how I did. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! There is no call to action or newsletter subscription; I genuinely appreciate your time!
