I\'ve worked on everything from \nHello World software to a to-do app. I\'ve worked on projects that have \none user and projects that have zero users. I\'ve worked on projects that \nhave never been used by the public and projects that have never been used by \nme. But let\'s not focus on my credentials; they\'re solid, trust me, bro. \nSome guy on the internet said the following at some time:\n> If there\'s an API, we\'ll program the software instead of using it.\n> \n> ~ Me, and probably someone else\n\nI don\'t know what an API is, but if I\'m ever using software that has an API, \nI\'ll most definitely start programming it instead of using the software. \nEspecially if I\'m supposed to be doing something else with the software. I \nwon\'t do the thing that I\'m supposed to be doing; I\'ll fiddle with the API \ninstead to streamline my workflow.\n\nJust the other day, I decided to take a break from my Hello World app and \nproduce music with Reaper, a digital audio workstation. What did I make?\nA script that makes music production easier. I didn\'t actually use the\nscript to make music; I just spent three days building the script and \nthen I went back to programming my Hello World app. My life has no creative\nfullfillment, but at least I know that when I go back to making music again,\nthat script is there waiting for me, begging for me to refactor it.\n\nWhy do programmers do this? We can\'t help it. We don\'t use software, we program it. \nUnless we\'re supposed to use the software to program the software. No, wait, \nwe\'ll program the software to program the software too. Oh, how is my \nHello World app doing? Not good. I haven\'t worked on it because I\'m too \nbusy configuring my Neovim setup.\n','api-problem'),(3,'---\ntitle: Reflecting on 2023\ndescription: In this short article, I reflect on my technical progress from 2023 and set some new goals for the upcoming year.\ndate: 2024-01-01\nimage: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1699275303964-a9a1a8ae8c6b?q=80&w=3270&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\ntags:\n  - Non-Technical\n  - 2024\n---\n\n2023 was an incredibly fruitful year regarding my development as a.. developer. Here are some of the things I worked on:\n- Created a static website for my biology final.\n- Created a random data generator tool with `React` with a responsive web UI\n- Created some scripts for my music hobbies for both Reaper and Renoise digital audio workstations, \nexposing me `Lua`. \n- Created a personal portfolio site with `React`. Then, I built it again in `NextJS` from scratch. \n- Ditched VS Code in favor of a custom Neovim setup. Those Lua skills came in handy when I spent a week building out my editor configurations. \n- Built a C++ command line program that converted ripped SNES music (SPC format) to playable/remixable WAV format for music production. \n- Created a command line tool that fetches my previously defined coding templates from a GitHub repo. This makes creating prototypes and starting new projects a breeze!\n- Built a content management system with `Markdown` and `React`. I built it again for my new site using `MDX`. I learned so much about building and rendering content through markdown!\n- Learned how to deploy my projects on a virtual private server. \n- Created a basic 3D rendering application with `C++` and `OpenGL`.\n- Completed Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Development, Computer Architecture & Assembly, Introduction to Computer Graphics Programming, and Operating Systems 1. These courses tied many previously loosely understood concepts together for me. \n- Registered for the Codepath iOS course, which will guide me through building an iOS app in February 2024. \n\nDespite the majority of 2023 feeling like I wasn\'t making any technical progress (I spent over half the year focusing on non-CS general education requirements for my degree), I\'m delighted with my overall output.\n\nI\'m certain that I\'ll see even more growth in 2024. Here is a list of goals that I hope to accomplish this year:\n- Finish [this](https://berrin-com.vercel.app/) website.\n- Create a landing page/booking system for a nail technician.\n- Create a 3D website using `Three.js`.\n- Create a space on my website to host my GLSL shader creations.\n- Create a metronome app for iOS. \n- Find an internship.\n\nMost of my curriculum is filled with CS-related work this year, so I hope to blow this list out of the water. I\'ll check on this in a year and see how I did. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading! There is no call to action or newsletter subscription; I genuinely appreciate your time!\n','2023-reflection');

This name is used for organizational purposes\n# and does not determine the names of any output binaries.\nproject(MyProject)\n\n# Add an executable target to the project. This command specifies that an \n# executable named MyApp should be built from the source file main.cpp.\n# You can add more source files separated by spaces if needed.\nadd_executable(MyApp main.cpp)\n\n# (Optional) If you have other source files or libraries to include, \n# you can use commands like `target_link_libraries` or `target_include_directories`.\n```\n```Cpp\n// main.cpp:\n#include <iostream> \nint main(){   std::cout << \"Hello World!\" << std::endl;   return 0; }\n```\n```Bash\n# Create a build folder\nmkdir build \ncd build \ncmake -S .. -B . # S and D flags represent source dir and build dir\n```\n```Bash\n# Build the project\nmake # (from the build directory)\n```\n## Adding a library\nCreate a new directory, `my_library` (or any name). I\'ll create an example library called `adder`. I\'ll also create two files in this directory: `adder.h` and `adder.cpp`.\n``` Cpp\n// adder.h:\nnamespace mymath{ 	int add(int a, int b); 	float add(float a, float b); }\n```\n```cpp\n// adder.cpp:\n#include \"adder.h\" int mymath::add(int a, int b){ 	return a + b; } float mymath::add(float a, float b){ 	return a + b; }\n```\n```bash\n# CMakeLists.txt:\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2) \nproject(MyProject) \nadd_executable(MyApp main.cpp)\n\n# Add the library directory to the include path. This is where the \n# header file is located.\ninclude_directories(my_library)\n\n# Add the library. First argument is what you want to name the target,\n# and the second argument is the path to the library source files.\nadd_library(Adder my_library/adder.cpp) \n\n# Link the library to the executable. and INTERFACE. \ntarget_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE Adder)\n```\n<Callout>\nNote that `PRIVATE` represents the visibility of the library. `PRIVATE` means that the library is only used by the target. Other options are `PUBLIC` and `INTERFACE`. `PUBLIC` means that the library is used by the target and any targets that link to this target. `INTERFACE` means that the library is used by any targets that link to this target, but not the target itself. \n\nIn our case, the target is `MyApp`, but bigger projects may have multiple targets, so the visibility options are a powerful way to control dependencies.\n</Callout>\n```cpp\n// main.cpp\n#include <iostream> \n#include \"adder.h\" \nint main()\n{     \n	int a = 1;     \n	int b = 2;     \n	std::cout << \"a + b = \" << mymath::add(a, b) << std::endl;     \n	return 0; \n}\n```\n\nWith this setup, we can go to the **build** directory and build the project:\n```bash\ncd build\nmake\n```\n\n## Linking a compiled library\n\nThe above approach works for linking a library when you have access to the source code and you want to compile the library yourself.\nHowever, sometimes you may not have access to the library source code. Sometimes, you only have access to the compiled library file. \nNote that compiled libraries still need a header file to use them.\nCompiled libraries usually have these file extensions:\n\n**STATIC**: `.a`, `.lib`\n\n**SHARED**: `.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`\n\n<Callout>\nNote that `.lib` and `.dll` are used on Windows, `.a` and `.so` are used on Linux, and `.a` and `.dylib` are used on macOS.\n</Callout>\n\nStatic means that a library will be compiled into your executable. This means that the library code is \"embedded\" into your final application. \nIf multiple executable files use it, then the library code will be duplicated in each of them. \n\nA shared library is not embedded into your application. Instead, it is loaded at runtime. This means that if multiple executable files use it, \nthen the library code will be loaded only once in memory. However, this also means that you need to distribute the library \nfile with your application and make sure that the library is available on the user\'s machine. Static libraries are usually easier to use, \nbut shared libraries are more efficient. Here\'s how to link a pre-compiled library:\n\nIn this example, I\'ll use two files in the `my_library` directory:\n```bash\nlibAdder.a # static library\nadder.h    # library header file\n```\n```bash\n# CMakeLists.txt\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2) \nproject(MyProject) \nadd_executable(MyApp main.cpp) \ninclude_directories(my_library) \ntarget_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/my_library/libAdder.a)\n```\n\nI\'m including the header file in the `my_library` directory, then I\'m calling `target_link_libraries` \nthe same way as before, but this time linking to the `a` file. Although I\'m linking a static library,\nthe approach is the same for the other types as well.\n\nNote that `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` is part of the Cmake API and it represents the root directory where `CMakeLists.txt` is located.\n','cmake-cheatsheet'),(3,'---\ncategory: Web Development\ntitle: CSS Tricks\ndescription: Cool tricks that I don\'t want to forget.\ndate: \"2023-12-05\"\ntags:\n  - CSS\n---\n\n## Reactive modal\nSet width to `700px`.

This domain is pointed to the IP address of the virtual server.\n- `localhost:3000` is the address of the Node instance I want to open up to the public internet.\n\n### Enabling the Configuration\n---\nNext, I\'ll enable the configuration by creating a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory.\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dev /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n```\nWe can check that the link was created successfully by running:\n```bash\nls -l /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n```\nYou should be able to see `dev` in the output.\n\nWe can restart NGINX to apply the changes:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\nIf you get an error, you can check the logs by running:\n```bash\nsudo cat /var/log/nginx/error.log\n```\n#### Optional\nYou can secure your domain using Certbot. [How?](https://www.bgevko.com/blog/https-using-certbot)\n\n### Conclusion\n---\nYou\'re all set!
